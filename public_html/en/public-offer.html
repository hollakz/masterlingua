                    their obligations under this Agreement, if such failure was a consequence of force majeure
                    circumstances (force majeure), namely: floods, other natural disasters, military actions, decisions
                    and decisions of state authorities or others events. A proper confirmation of the presence of force

                    first response to the claim, the Parties did not reach any agreements, then the Party, whose right
                    has been violated, has the right to apply to the court at the location of the Contractor to protect
                    their right.</p>

                    package, if the Client wishes to change the teacher for any reason, they can do so by selecting a
                    teacher whose lesson price matches the price of the previous teacher's lessons. If the Client
                    chooses a teacher whose lesson price is higher, the Client agrees to pay the price difference
                    between the packages.</p>
